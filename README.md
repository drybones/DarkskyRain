# DarkskyRain

Simple "is it going to rain?" visualisation using the Apple [WeatherKit API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/weatherkitrestapi) (formerly the Dark Sky API) and [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/). Shows probablity charts for the next hour and the next 24 hours. Rain intensity is indicated by bubble size.
